# Ways to Improve

- Find better benchmarks for data (i.e. algorithmically) so color stops can be
  better set, making differences more apparent
- Instead of trying to display *all* the data, try hypothesizing as to what
  might be related before I dive in
- Use well-tested and standardized libraries for simple tasks even if you 
  already included a large one
- Include more dynamically-updated graphs
- Increase granularity of analytical tools given to the user
  * Allow for individual places to be interacted with on the map
  * Same as above, but for tweets
  * Make search radius configurable
- Account for error margins given in census data
- Make use of public icon libraries to give more visual cues for things like
  Facebook place type, UI interactions, etc.
