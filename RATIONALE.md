# Rationale

## Libraries used

Some light research posed Mapbox GL JS and Leaflet as two viable options for displaying the map onto which the visualizations would be superimposed. Looking at their respective APIs, Mapbox seemed a better choice, as it had a much greater breadth and depth of functionality. Were the map not the focal point of the app, Leaflet would have likely won out, as its API does seem much cleaner, at the expense of some power.
